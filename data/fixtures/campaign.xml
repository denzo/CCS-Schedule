When a child is very sick, and potentially needs to travel for treatment it can place enormous emotional and financial stress on the family – transport and accommodation costs alone can be difficult, especially if the parent is unable to work. Child cover is an economical way to ease this risk.&#10;&#10;Child Cover can pay out a lump sum of up to $250,000, should something fatal or traumatic happen to a covered child. These funds can be used to pay for all sorts of expenses, including:&#10;• Specialist or overseas medical treatment&#10;• Home nursing care&#10;• Home or car modifications&#10;• Meeting other financial commitments, such as mortgage payments or school fees, if you aren’t able to work while caring for your child.&#10;' ows_Portfolio='Insurance' ows_Objective='Retention' ows_TestAndLearn='0' ows_StartDate='2014-01-24 00:00:00' ows_Frequency='One-Off' ows_Stage='schedule' ows_Channel_ids='25' ows_Preanalysis_id='10' ows_Override='0' ows_Product='Life Protection' ows_DueDate='2014-01-24 00:00:00' ows_Assignee='19982;#Hussain, Asaf' ows_Created='2013-12-20 12:05:44' ows_Author='55034;#McPherson, Nev' ows_Modified='2014-01-30 14:51:14' ows_Editor='26516;#Alimovs, Deniss' ows_Change='0' ows_Odf='http://myteamspace.cba/sites/rbs/DDM/Lists/prodcampaign/Attachments/15/Campaign-15-ODF 20 Dec 2013 (12-05-46 PM).docx' ows__ModerationStatus='0' ows__Level='1' ows_UniqueId='15;#{D7A51045-1DA7-423D-80A0-06ADBF3B8B86}' ows_FSObjType='15;#0' ows_Created_x0020_Date='15;#2013-12-20 12:05:44' ows_MetaInfo='15;#' ows_Title='CommInsure Child Cover offer x-sell' ows_owshiddenversion='14' ows_FileLeafRef='15;#15_.000' ows_FileRef='15;#sites/rbs/DDM/Lists/prodcampaign/15_.000' />

This aims to drive an average of 2,355 referrals each week over March/April 2014 (255 incremental referrals each week), resulting in $3.67 mill revenue (NPV).&#10;&#10;Our core target market are the 45+ year olds who are starting to think more about their future and are more likely to be in the position to build their wealth for retirement. These people have not experienced financial planning and may not understand its importance. Financial planning isn’t just about making more money, it’s about creating opportunities to live a better life. These people may want to achieve financial security for their children, retire five years earlier or go on that dream holiday. Getting good advice and financial planning can help them make the most out of every opportunity, however people may find it difficult to find the motivation to see a financial planner.&#10;&#10;Our financial planners offer services to allow people to reach their goals. CFP has been providing financial advice to Australians for more than two decades.  It is part of the largest financial institution in Australia and is so confident in the value of its service that the first consultation with a planner is free. The Commonwealth Bank brand is the most recognised brand in the Australian financial services industry.  CBA provides affordable products and high quality service to help customers navigate through the complexities of financial planning to make it simple and easy to understand.&#10;' ows_Portfolio='Financial Planning' ows_Objective='Acquisition' ows_TestAndLearn='1' ows_StartDate='2014-04-01 00:00:00' ows_Frequency='One-Off' ows_MarketingID='10001258' ows_Stage='schedule' ows_Channel_ids='26,93' ows_Preanalysis_id='8' ows_Override='0' ows_Product='Financial Planning' ows_DueDate='2014-04-01 00:00:00' ows_Assignee='19264;#Truong, Lily' ows_Created='2013-12-20 13:14:27' ows_Author='6726;#Macolino, Nancy' ows_Modified='2014-01-30 14:51:16' ows_Editor='26516;#Alimovs, Deniss' ows_Change='0' ows_Odf='http://myteamspace.cba/sites/rbs/DDM/Lists/prodcampaign/Attachments/16/Campaign-16-ODF 20 Dec 2013 (1-14-29 PM).docx' ows__ModerationStatus='0' ows__Level='1' ows_UniqueId='16;#{99598CE5-D917-4A42-A48C-E22B4FDB248C}' ows_FSObjType='16;#0' ows_Created_x0020_Date='16;#2013-12-20 13:14:27' ows_MetaInfo='16;#' ows_Title='Comm Financial Planning Acquisition April 2014' ows_owshiddenversion='15' ows_FileLeafRef='16;#16_.000' ows_FileRef='16;#sites/rbs/DDM/Lists/prodcampaign/16_.000' />

Current experience shows that in some instances, PayTags do not work as smoothly as PayPass cards. This can potentially lead to poor customer experience and customer abandoning the technology. Where the PT is placed on the phone, how customer hold the phone over the terminal and the type of terminal used are all critical factors that we need to communicate to customers&#10;&#10;Therefore we want to communicate top tips for customers so that their payment at POS is simple and easy. This is critical to ensure the success of our mobile payments initiatives as customers may otherwise lose faith in these technologies. Given our current CAPEX investment of ~$2.7m and future marketing spend of ~$5m, we want the PayTag and Tap &amp; Pay to be a success.&#10;&#10;These top tips will be shown to customers when they activate their PayTag using the CommBank app. However, this will only go live in end March. Until such point, we will target customers who have ordered the PT (retrospectively) via a broadcast message on the CommBank app informing them of these top tips.
